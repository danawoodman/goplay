# Object Composition

A simple example of OOP using Go; specifically composing objects together (similar to inheritance).

This creates a `Person` type and then a `Woman` type that embeds a `Person` type within it.

It also shows an example usage of pointers in Go.

# Usage

As with most other of the examples, you build the `.go` file and run it:

```bash
go build
./composition
```
