# Simple Server

A simple server implementation using pure Go.

## Usage

Build the package and run the executable:

```bash
go build
./simple-server
```

This will start the webserver and keep it running. Now, open up your web browser and go to <http://localhost:1234/hello>. You should now see "hello world"!
