# GoPlay

A set of [Golang](http://golang.org) examples, starting at the most basic "Hello World" example.

## Install Go

If you're on a Mac and you use [Homebrew]() you can install go by running:

```bash
brew install go
```

... and you're ready!

If you don't have Homebrew, you can install [go in many other ways](http://golang.org/doc/install).

## Running Examples

Most examples can be run by just running `go build` and executing the generated binary file:

```bash
cd helloworld
go build
./helloworld
```

All the examples have a README file explaining what they do and how to run them.
